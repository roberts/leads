## Models

We include the following model in this package:

**List of Models**

- Lead
- Lead Business

For each of these models, this package implements an [authorization policy](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/authorization) that extends the roles and permissions approach of the [tipoff/authorization](https://github.com/tipoff/authorization) package. The policies for each model in this package are registered through the package and do not need to be registered manually.

The models also have [Laravel Nova resources](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/3.0/resources/) in this package and they are also registered through the package and do not need to be registered manually.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
